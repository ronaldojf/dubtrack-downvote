## dubtrack-downvote

Do you feel like rebeling against society but what you do all day is just listening to songs in [dubtrack.fm](https://www.dubtrack.fm)? You can do it now by automatically downvoting every music playing! Of course, those you liked can be manually upvoted without a hassle.

Originally a fork from **[dubtrack-tweaks](https://github.com/patricknelson/dubtrack-tweaks)**
